#fire detection using HAAR cascade classifier.
Install python and its cv2 package and numpy package
Note: trying to run on VS code : python
<p>A design of visual fire detector using HAAR cascard classifier. We use the machine learning algorithm to train the machine to differentiate fire positive images from fire negitive images. The end result of the training gives an xml file which is used to further classify/ detect the presence of fire from the concurrent images of the input video feed.</P>
